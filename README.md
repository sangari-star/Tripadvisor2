I Created a Tripadvisor Website 


🌍 TripAdvisor Clone – Webpage Description
This project is a TripAdvisor-style travel webpage built using HTML and CSS. It features a clean, responsive design that showcases top travel destinations, user reviews, hotel listings, and travel tips. The site layout includes a header with navigation, a hero section with a search bar, featured destinations in a grid layout, and a footer with contact and social media links.

Key Features:

🗺️ Home Page: Highlights popular destinations with eye-catching images and brief descriptions.

🏨 Listings Section: Displays hotels and attractions using card layouts, complete with ratings and pricing.

✍️ Review Section: Includes sample user reviews with star ratings and user avatars.

🔍 Search Bar: Allows users to search for destinations or activities.

📱 Responsive Design: Fully responsive using CSS media queries to ensure compatibility across devices.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for semantic structure and layout

CSS3 for styling, layout design, and responsiveness (Flexbox/Grid)

Font Awesome or icon fonts (optional) for star ratings and navigation icons

This project demonstrates foundational front-end development skills and provides a strong starting point for building a more dynamic travel recommendation website.
